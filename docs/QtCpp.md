# Qt C++ Integration

## Overview

The developers of Distribution Builder work in many languages and frameworks extending
beyond Python.  Ultimately, we hope to provide a collection of rapid integration modules
for this library into for other modes of software development.  

The first of these integrations we are rolling out is a ready means to allow your 
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) C++ programs to flow directly into this tool.  The library can 
then be used as a middleman between the [Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/) IDE and the  
[Qt Installer Framework](http://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework).  

This mechanism provides far more flexibliy than simply connecting those tools, however.  
Other packages, notably Python based programs, can be built and bundled together simultaneously.
This design pattern gives you the full power of Distribution Builder (and Python on the whole) 
by which to extend your Qt build process.
